# Serial Terminal

*Serial Terminal* is a simple command line tool for Linux, for communicating
with devices connected over a UART. Received data is printed on screen and user
input is transmitted to the connected device.

# Installation

- Install the following dependencies:
  ```
  gcc make git
  ```
  for example, by entering the following command on a Debian-based system:
  ```
  sudo apt install gcc make git
  ```
- Clone this repository in the directory of your choice and enter it:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Kenneth-Goveas/Serial-Terminal.git <path>
  cd <path>
  ```
- Compile the program and install it:
  ```
  make
  sudo make install
  ```
- Once installed, you may remove the compiled binaries:
  ```
  make clean
  ```
- If you wish, you can easily uninstall the program:
  ```
  sudo make uninstall
  ```

# Usage

The following command opens a serial connection with a connected device:
```
serial-terminal -p <port> -b <baud> -i <iterm> -o <oterm>
```
Here, `<port>` is the path to the serial port, `<baud>` is the baud rate for
communication, and `<iterm>` and `<oterm>` are the input and output line
terminations.

The supported values of `<baud>` are: `50` `75` `110` `134` `150` `200` `300`
`600` `1200` `1800` `2400` `4800` `9600` `19200` `38400` `57600` `115200`
`230400` `460800` `500000` `576000` `921600` `1000000` `1152000` `1500000`
`2000000` `2500000` `3000000` `3500000` `4000000`.

Each of the line terminations `<iterm>` and `<oterm>` must be `cr`, `lf`, or
`crlf` corresponding to line termination characters CR, LF, and CR+LF.

Thus, the command to open a serial connection with a device connected to port
`/dev/ttyUSB0` that transmits lines terminated with CR+LF and expects to receive
lines terminated with CR, at a baud rate of 115200, would be:
```
serial-terminal -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200 -i crlf -o cr
```

To display a brief help page for this tool, enter the following command:
```
serial-terminal -h
```
